In the code, Diffrerent combinations of detectors and decriptors are carried out. Also the correspoding extracted keypoints and time taken for processing are also recorded. From the stored data, it has been observed that the top three combinations obtained are FAST + BRIEF, FAST + ORB and FAST + BRISK. It is because that the most important factor, time required for the operation is much less than the other counterparts combinations. Also the keypoints detected and natched are optimal too with less number of false matching and incorrect keypoints. So it has the much required balance of number of keypoints and efficient time
